## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to make the background shadow of a card or container sharp.

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
main{
    background-color: white;
    width: 335px;  
    height: 480px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items:flex-start;
    gap: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
    font-family: " https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree", sans-serif;
    /* justify-content: left; */
}
```
`

### Continued development

I wil focus more on using reactjs for the next set of tasks
